        <div class="TextBox TextRight Background2">
          Fixarr is a work in progress tool designed to allow anyone to take
          "broken" music files, with issues like being too loud, quiet and most
          importantly to me, possesing incorrect, missing, jumbled or misplaced
          metadata. As a bonus there are plans to (in the far future) have cross
          device backups, music info browsing, auto-tune, audio ripping from
          videos and automatic file organisation. Currently the project is at a
          bit of an uphill because i am being adament about having at least a
          variety of the program as a LUI, and microsoft just did not design the
          windows 11 console for this at all. The windows 10 console is much
          easier to use just because of small differences that stack up, and im
          not going to require everyone who wants to use the console version to
          roll their console back to windows 10. I will provide a GUI version
          after the 1.0, I do want people to actually use it, but just the idea
          of the possibility of having it as a powershell addon sparks something
          in me. Either way the

            >documentation for it is right here.</a

          I do plan on chucking the documentation onto this site eventually but
          as you can probably tell when you read it, I used it as an NEA for
          college, but there are currently higher priorities than reorganizing
          and reformatting the whole 200 pages. When i submitted it for my NEA
          it was more like 500 so ive done a lot already.

          This was mainly just an excuse to learn HTML, CSS, JS and PHP although
          it is something nice to have. I have a place to share (monetise)

          an informal CV. Looks good on LinkedIn.

          with him sorting out everything serverside and me looking pretty and
          trying to be helpful. He does have his own page also made by me so
          it's not like im a complete freeloader, plus there are a lot of plans
          on improving the server with more involvement on my part.

        <h3 class="Header">Radio / Aux / Bluetooth audio car sender:</h3>
        <div class="TextBox TextRight Background4">
          This is currently very much in the theoretical phase. I just want to
          make a single device that has capabilities for connecting to any cars
          speakers. This could be radio, aux or bluetooth depending on the car.
          It would be pretty simple, just the option of giving it files via usb,
          micro-sd, aux, bluetooth or internal storage, having those files
          processed and output via one of the aforementioned channels. The
          output and input will be changed via 2 independant scroll wheels and a
          screen / screenss to display the current settings. The screens
          shouldn't pose a problem for distracting the driver since it is a very
          set and done thing. I would also have the screens turn off after a
          couple seconds just to make extra sure that that is the case and save
          power. An issue posed is how songs are changed and paused. Adding more
          buttons that are connected wirelessly would needlessly drain power and
          recharging the buttons would be a pain not even talking about how easy
          it would be to lose them. a whole wireless pannel would avoid the last
          two problems but customisability on placement of the buttons would
          suffer greatly. Keeping the buttons on the device would make it
          difficult to change and dangerous to do while driving and having the
          aforementioned panel be attached by a wire would be clunky and
          inconvinient although it does seem to be my favourite sollution so far
          and exposed wires are my jam. There are options to integrate other
          ways of changing the music like if the car has bluetooth and already
          has media buttons built in that would be nice. Voice controls would be
          fun.

          project than my own however i am helping greatly with assets and
          general design. The idea was a game similar to any simulator game but
          quickly evolved into a meddley of fun features more akin to the good
          <abbr title="Need for Speed">NFS</abbr>
          games than anything else. Upgradability, boost, time trials, ramps,
          basically all the fun things. The project itself hasn't gottan very
          far because Isaac decided to completely scrap our first two attempts
          due to unexplained bloat in the files and generally being not well
          thought out. Later we got occupied with other things, like other
          projects and getting laid. We are taking a lot of inspiration from
          <a href="http://rockofages2.com/">
            Rock of Ages 2: Bigger and Boulder
          </a>
          because the first and third ones kind of sucked and the second one
          was basically how we spent our entire first year at college along with

            Peggle Deluxe.
          </a>
          We haven't given up on this project yet but it is a lot less straighforward
          than most other things we are working on / have worked on so a little motivation
          and a lot of free time are neccessary to do anything. I don't mean to be
          petty but the last change made was me adding the entire river hamble as a map, 
          so the ball is in Isaac's court, I haven't added any trees, buildings, bridges
          or really any set pieces but that's not the point.

            I love walking and climbing through different ranges, i have been
            all over The UK, from Snowdonia to the Highlands, aswell as Poland,
            including the tatras and Bieszczady. My greatest achievements in
            this are probably doing Crib Goch along with Glyder Fawr and Glyder
            Fach in one go aswell as the hardest routes up Tryfan all in awful
            conditions, but my truly greatest feat is doing the trail from the
            sea's eye lake up to the Rysy peak and back, a trail that takes
            about 7.5 hours total, in around 3.5 hours. I kept getting people
            talking to me both ways, talking about how they had seen me going up
            and back down while they had only just started nearing the top.

            That was the first time i had been allowed to go off on my own (a
            decision that my mother regretted soon after my departure and then
            spent the next 3 hours panicking about) and it felt better than
            anything else did. After that trial by 14 year old me my current
            goal has been to complete the eagle's perch trail and even extend it
            to Świnica. There have been two attempts at this so far. The first
            ended with my climbing partner chickening out and us taking a side
            route to get down, the second ended with me getting about 1/3 of the
            way across after which very shakey and generally weak, which hadnt
            been too surprising seeing as I didn't bring any food (it was a
            monday, could not buy anything the previous day (dumb polish laws)).
            When i did finally get to my hostel it turned out I had a rather bad
            case of food poisoning but this didn't impact the trip too much
            since it was raining for the rest of our outing.

            experience down to a series of pixels takes away from the
            experience, and my climbing partner, who does not share that
            opinion, was too busy shitting themselves to take any. piechurek7
            was the only source of images that I found to give the trail any
            justice (while having no cc license), and messing around with
            embedding videos and rights to those videos would be too bothersome.
            You're a capable young person, if you were that interested you could
            do your own research.

            Other than Hiking i cycle and walk a considerable ammount. One time
            I walked from Zamość to Krasnobród in a single day (about 8 hours /
            30km). The plan was to continue further on to Józefów, Zwierzyniec
            and Sczebrzeszyn, throwing down a tent near each one (would've been
            about 100km total), however after that one day I had gotten rather
            lost twice, which i will blame on bad trail markings, and along with
            the intense heat and awfully beaten down shoes, i ended up getting
            blisters too bad to walk on and found a coach going back to Zamość.
            I ended up bedridden for a couple of days but I consider this a

            Cycling wise my most recent ride worth talking about was from
            Andover to Southampton and back in the same day. The plan was to go
            to Lyndhurst which would have been about the same distance but I
            decided that taking a selfie by the water and sending it to my
            mother would have been much funnier. Southampton however is an
            absolute mess and actually getting to any water was more difficult
            than the cycle itself. Did not help that my phone was pretty much
            dead and that i got distracted and rather lost around the town
            centre and train tracks. Either way i did actually achieve what i
            had set out to do for once, The only reprecussion of which was a
            minor incident the next day of my heart going absolutely balistic
            and me getting sent home from college but i refuse to accept that
            those are related.

            Among other sports I like to occasionally go out on my longboard
            which was a present from my brother after my previous board, also a
            present from him, became too small for my 33.5cm feet. I do usually
            opt for just going out on my bike, even if it is a bit awful to use.
            I have also enjoyed ice skating and rollerblading to a great extent
            but the aforementioned 33.5cm feet sort of limit me here. For the
            price of roller blades that actually fit me I could also get a good
            bike that I can actually sit up on, not even mentioning how
            expensive ice skates are and how little use I would get out of them.
            When it comes to group sports I do like badminton and tennis when I
            occasionally get someone to play with and I have been trying to get
            back into basketball after near daily comments about my stance on
            the sport.
