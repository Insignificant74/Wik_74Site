                    I love walking and climbing through different ranges, i have been all over The UK, from Snowdonia to the Highlands, aswell as Poland, 
                    including the tatras and Bieszczady. My greatest achievements in this are probably doing Crib Goch along with Glyder Fawr and 
                    Glyder Fach in one go aswell as the hardest routes up Tryfan all in awful conditions, but my truly greatest feat is doing the trail 
                    from the sea's eye lake up to the Rysy peak and back, a trail that takes about 7.5 hours total, in around 3.5 hours. I kept getting
                    people talking to me both ways, talking about how they had seen me going up and back down while they had only just started nearing 
                    the top.

                    That was the first time i had been allowed to go off on my own (a decision that my mother regretted soon after my departure 
                    and then spent the next 3 hours panicking about) and it felt better than anything else did. After that trial by 14 year old me my
                    current goal has been to complete the eagle's perch trail and even extend it to Świnica. There have been two attempts at this so far.
                    The first ended with my climbing partner chickening out and us taking a side route to get down, the second ended with me getting about 
                    1/3 of the way across after which very shakey and generally weak, which hadnt been too surprising seeing as I didn't bring any food 
                    (it was a monday, could not buy anything the previous day (dumb polish laws)). When i did finally get to my hostel it turned out
                    I had a rather bad case of food poisoning but this didn't impact the trip too much since it was raining for the rest of our outing.

                    I personally feel that stopping to take images and narrow the experience down to a series of pixels takes away from the experience, 
                    and my climbing partner, who does not share that opinion, was too busy shitting themselves to take any. piechurek7 was the only 
                    source of images that i found to give the trail any justice (while having no cc license), and messing around with embedding videos 
                    and rights to those videos would be too bothersome. You're a capable young person, if you were that interested you could do your own 
                    research.
