            Fixarr is a work in progress tool designed to allow anyone to take
            "broken" music files, with issues like being too loud, quiet and
            most importantly to me, possesing incorrect, missing, jumbled or
            misplaced metadata. As a bonus there are plans to (in the far
            future) have cross device backups, music info browsing, auto-tune,
            audio ripping from videos and automatic file organisation. Currently
            the project is at a bit of an uphill because i am being adament
            about having at least a variety of the program as a LUI, and
            microsoft just did not design the windows 11 console for this at
            all. The windows 10 console is much easier to use just because of
            small differences that stack up, and im not going to require
            everyone who wants to use the console version to roll their console
            back to windows 10. I will provide a GUI version after the 1.0, I do
            want people to actually use it, but just the idea of the possibility
            of having it as a powershell addon sparks something in me. Either

            I do plan on chucking the documentation onto this site eventually
            but as you can probably tell when you read it, I used it as an NEA
            for college, but there are currently higher priorities than
            reorganizing and reformatting the whole 200 pages. When i submitted
            it for my NEA it was more like 500 so ive done a lot already.

            This is currently very much in the theoretical phase. I just want to
            make a single device that has capabilities for connecting to any
            cars speakers. This could be radio, aux or bluetooth depending on
            the car. It would be pretty simple, just the option of giving it
            files via usb, micro-sd, aux, bluetooth or internal storage, having
            those files processed and output via one of the aforementioned
            channels. The output and input will be changed via 2 independant
            scroll wheels and a screen / screenss to display the current
            settings. The screens shouldn't pose a problem for distracting the
            driver since it is a very set and done thing. I would also have the
            screens turn off after a couple seconds just to make extra sure that
            that is the case and save power. An issue posed is how songs are
            changed and paused. Adding more buttons that are connected
            wirelessly would needlessly drain power and recharging the buttons
            would be a pain not even talking about how easy it would be to lose
            them. a whole wireless pannel would avoid the last two problems but
            customisability on placement of the buttons would suffer greatly.
            Keeping the buttons on the device would make it difficult to change
            and dangerous to do while driving and having the aforementioned
            panel be attached by a wire would be clunky and inconvinient
            although it does seem to be my favourite sollution so far and
            exposed wires are my jam. There are options to integrate other ways
            of changing the music like if the car has bluetooth and already has
            media buttons built in that would be nice. Voice controls would be
            fun.

            project than my own however i am helping greatly with ../Assets and
            general design. The idea was a game similar to any simulator game
            but quickly evolved into a meddley of fun features more akin to the
            good
            <abbr title="Need for Speed">NFS</abbr>
            games than anything else. Upgradability, boost, time trials, ramps,
            basically all the fun things. The project itself hasn't gottan very
            far because Isaac decided to completely scrap our first two attempts
            due to unexplained bloat in the files and generally being not well
            thought out. Later we got occupied with other things, like other
            projects and getting laid. We are taking a lot of inspiration from
            <a href="http://rockofages2.com/">
              Rock of Ages 2: Bigger and Boulder
            </a>
            because the first and third ones kind of sucked and the second one
            was basically how we spent our entire first year at college along
            with
            <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3480/Peggle_Deluxe/">
              Peggle Deluxe.
            </a>
            We haven't given up on this project yet but it is a lot less
            straighforward than most other things we are working on / have
            worked on so a little motivation and a lot of free time are
            neccessary to do anything. I don't mean to be petty but the last
            change made was me adding the entire river hamble as a map, so the
            ball is in Isaac's court, I haven't added any trees, buildings,
            bridges or really any set pieces but that's not the point.

              I love walking and climbing through different ranges, i have been
              all over The UK, from Snowdonia to the Highlands, aswell as
              Poland, including the tatras and Bieszczady. My greatest
              achievements in this are probably doing Crib Goch along with
              Glyder Fawr and Glyder Fach in one go aswell as the hardest routes
              up Tryfan all in awful conditions, but my truly greatest feat is
              doing the trail from the sea's eye lake up to the Rysy peak and
              back, a trail that takes about 7.5 hours total, in around 3.5
              hours. I kept getting people talking to me both ways, talking
              about how they had seen me going up and back down while they had
              only just started nearing the top.

              That was the first time i had been allowed to go off on my own (a
              decision that my mother regretted soon after my departure and then
              spent the next 3 hours panicking about) and it felt better than
              anything else did. After that trial by 14 year old me my current
              goal has been to complete the eagle's perch trail and even extend
              it to Świnica. There have been two attempts at this so far. The
              first ended with my climbing partner chickening out and us taking
              a side route to get down, the second ended with me getting about
              1/3 of the way across after which very shakey and generally weak,
              which hadnt been too surprising seeing as I didn't bring any food
              (it was a monday, could not buy anything the previous day (dumb
              polish laws)). When i did finally get to my hostel it turned out I
              had a rather bad case of food poisoning but this didn't impact the
              trip too much since it was raining for the rest of our outing.

              experience, and my climbing partner, who does not share that
              opinion, was too busy shitting themselves to take any. piechurek7
              was the only source of images that I found to give the trail any
              justice (while having no cc license), and messing around with
              embedding videos and rights to those videos would be too
              bothersome. You're a capable young person, if you were that
              interested you could do your own research.

              Other than Hiking i cycle and walk a considerable ammount. One
              time I walked from Zamość to Krasnobród in a single day (about 8
              hours / 30km). The plan was to continue further on to Józefów,
              Zwierzyniec and Sczebrzeszyn, throwing down a tent near each one
              (would've been about 100km total), however after that one day I
              had gotten rather lost twice, which i will blame on bad trail
              markings, and along with the intense heat and awfully beaten down
              shoes, i ended up getting blisters too bad to walk on and found a
              coach going back to Zamość. I ended up bedridden for a couple of
              days but I consider this a worthwile wxperience

              Cycling wise my most recent ride worth talking about was from
              Andover to Southampton and back in the same day. The plan was to
              go to Lyndhurst which would have been about the same distance but
              I decided that taking a selfie by the water and sending it to my
              mother would have been much funnier. Southampton however is an
              absolute mess and actually getting to any water was more difficult
              than the cycle itself. Did not help that my phone was pretty much
              dead and that i got distracted and rather lost around the town
              centre and train tracks. Either way i did actually achieve what i
              had set out to do for once, The only reprecussion of which was a
              minor incident the next day of my heart going absolutely balistic
              and me getting sent home from college but i refuse to accept that
              those are related.

              Among other sports I like to occasionally go out on my longboard
              which was a present from my brother after my previous board, also
              a present from him, became too small for my 33.5cm feet. I do
              usually opt for just going out on my bike, even if it is a bit
              awful to use. I have also enjoyed ice skating and rollerblading to
              a great extent but the aforementioned 33.5cm feet sort of limit me
              here. For the price of roller blades that actually fit me I could
              also get a good bike that I can actually sit up on, not even
              mentioning how expensive ice skates are and how little use I would
              get out of them. When it comes to group sports I do like badminton
              and tennis when I occasionally get someone to play with and I have
              been trying to get back into basketball after near daily comments
              about my stance on the sport.

              I can and have sat for hours on end with laptops, lamps, washing
              machines, audio sets, kettles, record players and really anything
              electrical, just taking it apart and learning what i can from the
              design. Recently I have actually found success in fixing something
              although with my limited "resources" it is often done in the most
              janky way possible. I am actually planning on getting a 1 year
              electrical qualification during my forced gap year that would
              allow me to "modify" other peoples electronics. From there it
              would be nice to house a little workshop in my apartment, staple a
              couple of ads around the area of Rzeszów and earn a little on the
              side, doing something I love. Other than that there isn't much
              more to say, other than a list of my appliance victims over the
              years.

                    My second laptop. It went through a lot, ram upgrades,
                    primary ssd failure and replacement, secondary ssd, bent
                    heatsink pipe (oops), broken body, failing hinges and a
                    whole lot more. In the end i had messed up the body so bad
                    that I glued the power button shut, drilled a hole through
                    it, and turned it on with a pen cartridge. The motherboard
                    overall was still in pretty good shape through it all
                    although i did eventually give up on it after constant blue
                    screens of death. resetting the OS would probably fix it but
                    I decided that the laptop probably earned its retirement.
                    Currently thinking about mounting it on my wall.

                    pretty bad shape and too low resistance to work in parallel
